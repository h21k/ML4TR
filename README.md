### Data 
Currently the data can not be made available here. Please contact us for individual requests.

### Machine Learning Methods
The following models have been used with this study:

#### Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

- `SVM` (for each trial register with hyperparaeters set according to [previous work](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/86954073/Marshall_et_al_2018_Research_Synthesis_Methods.pdf)

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- `CNN` (for each trial register with hyperparaeters set according to [previous work](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/86954073/Marshall_et_al_2018_Research_Synthesis_Methods.pdf)

#### Transformer Models

- `BERT Tensorflow` (Google) - with max token length of 128 
- `BERT PyTorch` (Google, Huggingface) - with max token length of 512 
- `SciBERT PyTorch` (Huggingface + Allen.AI weights) - with max token length of 512
- `BioBERT PyTorch` (Huggingface) `Excluded for the moment!`
